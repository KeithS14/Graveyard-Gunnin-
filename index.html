                Survive as many rounds as you can while earning points.
                But keep in mind, the difficulty increases each round!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You can change the difficulty to match your skill level but you can't change in the middle of playing.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Every 1000 points you gain a bonus life.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                G'luck!
